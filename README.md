# Description
Graph that attempts to summarize the state of large scale data management. I am creating this to help me deal with all of the papers I'm reading during my time as Masters student.

# How to use it
## Waiting patiently
I will occasionally publish a .pdf file to git repository when I get a chance.
## I can't wait anymore
* get graphviz
* get the latest JDK
* get Zoom Graph Viewer (zgrviewer)(http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html)
** Make sure not to get confused with zvtm like I originally did.
